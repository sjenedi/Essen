Project Selection Synopsis
Each team will select from one of the starter ideas below or select one of their own and check with the instructor for approval.  After selection, the team will capture several high-level characteristics and then “pitch” the application to the instructor.  As we move through the course, this application will form the foundation for numerous class activities (e.g. creating requirements, modeling system designs, etc.).  
Once the project work begins, each team will design and “build” the actual application.  The purpose of this course is to learn and practice project management as well as software design so actual programming towards the application is optional.  A series of deliverables will be assigned and the teams may fulfill those deliverables in several different ways, as will be discussed when we start the projects.

Optional Project Starter Ideas

Home Cooking
People who want to run a business serving sit-down meals within their home can use the service to find customers and schedule reservations, among other services.

Pet Lifestyles
This is an e-commerce service that provides clothing, home décor and other items to create an entire “lifestyle” for people’s pets (recommendation: think broadly about possible pets).

Just Like Being There
Create a mobile experience where people can virtually take friends and family on vacation with them when the other person can’t be there physically.

Real Time Law
A wide range of law services is made available remotely by providing real-time access to attorneys and related services (think tele-medicine for law).
Application Pitch
Each team may select one of these ideas or come up with one of their own.  Each idea listed likely has some corollary in the real world today but the goal is to make the application each team’s own by coming up with a unique marketing or technical angle for their version of the product.  
Use the template below to come up with a “pitch paragraph” and several related attributes which will guide development of your application.  This description of the application will guide initial exercises which involve the project and also serve as starting requirements for the full project.
